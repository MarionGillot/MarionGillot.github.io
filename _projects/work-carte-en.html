    <h3>The objective</h3>

  <div>
    <p>The objective of this project was to create a postcard based on the methods and techniques used by the artist
      Cassandre.
      Cassandre aka, Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron, who is a French graphic designer, typographer, poster artist, theatre
      decorator, lithographer and painter of the interwar period.

    <p>By hijacking the subject of the poster 'Dubonnet VIN TONIQUE DUBONNET WITH QUIQUENA' with Adobe illustrator, I
      then put this content in black to highlight it:
      In contrast with the background of the postcard, representing the beach, in Spain. This would be a postcard for
      holiday makers, those who visit the city,
      those who love the artist. </p>
