All you need to do is scan the image of the chosen work with your phone. If you do not have a VR headset, a version will also be available on your phone thanks to an app. All you have to do is scan the image of
the chosen work with your phone. If you don't have a VR headset, a version will also be
available on your phone via an app.
The visual representation will be animated and in 360° for an even more realistic experience, offering a
trip back in time!
