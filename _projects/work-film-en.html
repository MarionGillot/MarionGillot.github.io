    <p class="boldface">Summary</p>
    <p class="up">
      The chameleon, an animal that can camouflage itself in the wild and pass unnoticed without arousing any suspicion.
      This is the nickname the police gave him.
      His hatred and sadism are forged by his appalling acts, the origin of which nobody knows yet. His victims are only
      women with a specific character, young, elegant,
      dark-haired, and they gradually disappear into the city. Not even a piece of their corpse is ever found. </p>
    <p class="up">But the day he sets eyes on her, Angela Urker, everything changes. What happens when an invisible
      killer meets a soul more powerful than himself? Will he be found out? One thing is for sure, you have to be on
      your guard to survive...

    <p>The technique used to recreate the atmosphere of horror, mystery and the unknown is to camouflage the victim of
      the killer, who is also unknown to the viewer.
      the principle of a chameleon, the killer's victim, also unknown to the viewer.</p>
    <p class="up">We see hands of disproportionate proportions that further accentuate the monstrosity, the confusion.
      These hands at the level of the unknown character establish a mysterious and inquisitive link between them.</p>
    <p class="up">The title in red refers to the blood of its victims, which contrasts with the dark, emotionless
      background.
