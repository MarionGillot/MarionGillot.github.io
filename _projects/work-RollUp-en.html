    <h3>The objective</h3>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>The aim was to create a clear, striking and attractive visual that would enable visitors to quickly understand:
    <ul>
      <p>• Key figures for the company (performance, highlights, results)</p>
      <p>• The activities and services offered to customers, illustrating the company's added value</p>
      <p>• Geographical presence and locations, to highlight its influence and development</p>
    </ul>


The design was conceived to combine readability and visual impact, with a hierarchy of information that guides the viewer's gaze. The result is a professional, effective communication tool that reflects the company's identity.    </p>
